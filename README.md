# Introduction
We built a classifier for sentiment analysis from tweets, by learning from previously
classified tweets. The task was to built a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative) of
the text. TWe trainned the model on the existing data. The resulting model will
determine the class (neutral, positive, negative) of new texts (test data that were not used to build the
model) with maximum accuracy.

# How it runs ?
Run it on jupyter python. You will also find description for the project please check Sentiment Analysis Project_27955.pdf file for more details.
